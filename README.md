# Usage
- The file `.vim/bundle.vim` contains info about ![Vundle]('https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim') config, if you don't use `Vundle`, just ignore the whole `.vim` folder.
- Rename this file to `.vimrc` and copy it to your home dir.
- If you don't use `Vundle`, also remember to delete or comment out the **Vundle** in the `.vimrc`.
